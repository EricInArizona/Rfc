section-1
Introduction

   Successive TLS [The Transport Layer
 Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2 RFC5246]
 versions have added support for more cipher
   suites and, over time, more TLS extensions
 have been defined.  This
   has caused the size of the TLS
 ClientHello to grow, and the
   additional size has caused some
 implementation bugs to come to light.
   At least one of these implementation
 bugs can be ameliorated by
   making the ClientHello even larger.
  This is desirable given that
   fully comprehensive patching of
 affected implementations is difficult
   to achieve.

   This memo describes a TLS extension
 that can be used to pad a
   ClientHello to a desired size in
 order to avoid implementation bugs
   caused by certain ClientHello sizes.


section-2
Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119" title="&quot;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels&quot;">RFC2119</a>].



section-3
Padding Extension

   A new extension type ("padding(21)") is
 defined and MAY be included
   by the client in its ClientHello message.

   enum {
       padding(21), (65535)
   } ExtensionType;

   The "extension_data" for the extension
 consists of an arbitrary
   number of zero bytes.  For example,
 the smallest "padding" extension
   is four bytes long and is encoded as
 0x00 0x15 0x00 0x00.  A ten-byte
   extension would include six bytes of
 "extension_data" and would be
   encoded as:

   00 15 00 06 00 00 00 00 00 00
   |---| |---| |---------------|
     |     |           |
     |     |           \- extension_data: 6 zero bytes
     |     |
     |     \------------- 16-bit, extension_data length
     |
     \------------------- extension_type for padding extension

   The client MUST fill the padding
 extension completely with zero
   bytes, although the padding
extension_data field may be empty.

   The server MUST NOT echo the extension.



section-4
Example Usage

   As an example, consider a client that
 wishes to avoid sending a
   ClientHello with a TLSCiphertext.length
 between 256 and 511 bytes
   (inclusive).  This case is considered
 because at least one TLS
   implementation is known to hang the
 connection when such a
   ClientHello record is received.

   After building a ClientHello as normal,
 the client can add four bytes
   to the length (to account for the
 "msg_type" and "length" fields of
   the handshake protocol) and test whether
 the resulting length falls
   into that range.  If it does, a
 padding extension can be added in
   order to push the length to (at least)
 512 bytes.

   Note that if the original ClientHello
 size was between 505 and 507
   bytes, then, with the handshake protocol
 overhead, the record payload
   would be between 509 and 511 bytes
 long.  Since it's not possible for
   an extension to take less than four
 bytes of space, the additional
   padding would have to expand the
 ClientHello record payload beyond
   512 bytes in these cases.


section-5
Security Considerations

   The contents of the padding extension
 could be used as a covert
   channel.  In order to prevent this,
 the contents are required to be
   all zeros, although the length of the
 extension can still be used as
   a much smaller covert channel.


section-6
IANA Considerations

   IANA has permanently registered value 21
 (padding) in the
   "ExtensionType Values" registry.
